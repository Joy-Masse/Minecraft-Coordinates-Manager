# Minecraft Coordinates Manager
A simple CLI tool to manage your Minecraft coordinates.
Still in development. Such features are expected and not yet fully implemented:
 - Managing actual coordinates (an important one)
 - Storing data in JSON files
 - Automatic data backup via Google Drive
 - Removing worlds
 - Maybe something else
